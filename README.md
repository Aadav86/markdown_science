# Markdown for scientific writing

I'm a big evangelist for using [markdown](http://inundata.org/2012/06/01/markdown-and-the-future-of-collaborative-manuscript-writing/) to author documents in a scientific context. I've written about this several times on my blog but decided to put together a repo to help you learn and use this same workflow. If you spend a little time going through these examples, you will be able to [stop using Microsoft Word entirely](http://inundata.org/2012/12/04/how-to-ditch-word/) and write light-weight markdown files that can easily be version controlled by git. Collaboration with your coauthors can also become a whole lot simpler.

If you have git installed, simply clone this repo and you'll have a full set of examples to work with.

```
git clone git@github.com:karthikram/markdown_science.git
```
