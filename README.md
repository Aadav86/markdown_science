# Markdown for scientific writing

I'm a big evangelist for using [markdown](http://inundata.org/2012/06/01/markdown-and-the-future-of-collaborative-manuscript-writing/) to author documents in a scientific context. I've written about this several times on my blog but decided to put together a repo to help you learn and use this same workflow with a complete set of examples. If you spend a little time going through the tutorials, you'll  be able to [stop using Microsoft Word entirely](http://inundata.org/2012/12/04/how-to-ditch-word/) and write clean, lightweight markdown files that can easily be version controlled by git. Collaboration with your coauthors would also become way more powerful and simpler.

If you want to learn more about how git can improve your science, read my [upcoming article](http://figshare.com/articles/git_can_facilitate_greater_reproducibility_and_increased_transparency_in_science/153821) in BMC's source code in medicine and biology.
